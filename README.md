Up to the initial commit this project implements a small video game developed alongside a "Gaming in Go" completed tutorial made by Velovix on YouTube. This Go project leverages the Simple Direct Media Layer library (SDL) in a component based architecture.

Past the initial commit is development towards continuing three goals:

      Familiarise with the language of Go.
      Learn about unit testing in a new context.
      Develop a video game using a component "composition over inheritance" architecture as opposed to the standard object-oriented approach.
  
The aim is to get testing coverage up and running across system behavior and work towards a video game that implements:

      A controllable "Paint Gun" that can move around the screen.
      The ability to "fire" paint in 4 directions.
      The option to use Red, Green or Blue paint.
      Circles that can be filled up with either Red, Green or Blue paint.
      A layer that fills up with circles.
      A layer that can report it's percentage filled up with color.
      Multiple swappable layers to blend multiple circles together for a resulting color on circle overlaps.
