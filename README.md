Up to the initial commit this project implements a small video game developed alongside a "Gaming in Go" tutorial made by Velovix on YouTube.
Past the initial commit is unguided development towards continuing three goals:

      Familiarise with the language of Go.
      Learn about unit testing in a new context.
      Develop a video game using a component "composition over inheritance" architecture as opposed to the standard object-oriented approach.
  
This aim of the video game created from this project is to fill layers with circles of colors to combine the layers together towards a tasked overall color.
