Up to the initial commit this project implements a small video game developed alongside a "Gaming in Go" tutorial made by Velovix on YouTube.
Past the initial commit is unguided development towards continuing three goals:

      Familiarise with the language of Go.
      Learn about unit testing in a new context.
      Develop a video game using a component "composition over inheritance" architecture as opposed to the standard object-oriented approach.
  
The aim is to get testing coverage across the project and then work towards a video game based around filling layers with circles of color to combine the layers together towards a tasked overall color influenced by the circles.
